        I'm a 28 years old i graduated of computer engineering on 2019 in Duoc Uc, i have almost 3 years of working as front end developer currently i'm working as a mobile developer using react native, 
        but in the last year i was working with Ionic 4 and Angular 11. I like to read about
        new technology and try to learn it. One of my favorite board games is Ticket to ride and now i'm trying to be a Dungeon Master in D&D
